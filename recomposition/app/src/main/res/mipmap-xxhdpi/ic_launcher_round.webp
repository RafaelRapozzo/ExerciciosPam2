C<study> is now a no-op, presumably fixing all outstanding bugs related to
study causing regex matches to behave incorrectly!

=item *

When one writes C<open foo || die>, which used to work in Perl 4, a
"Precedence problem" warning is produced.  This warning used erroneously to
apply to fully-qualified bareword handle names not followed by C<||>.  This
has been corrected.

=item *

After package aliasing (C<*foo:: = *bar::>), C<select> with 0 or 1 argument
would sometimes return a name that could not be used to refer to the
filehandle, or sometimes it would return C<undef> even when a filehandle
was selected.  Now it returns a typeglob reference in such cases.

=item *

C<PerlIO::get_layers> no longer ignores some arguments that it thinks are
numeric, while treating others as filehandle names.  It is now consistent
for flat scalars (i.e., not references).

=item *

Unrecognized switches on C<#!> line

If a switch, such as B<-x>, that cannot occur on the C<#!> line is used
there, perl dies with "Can't emulate...".

It used to produce the same message for switches that perl did not
recognize at all, whether on the command line or the C<#!> line.

Now it produces the "Unrecognized switch" error message [perl #104288].

=item *

C<system> now temporarily blocks the SIGCHLD signal handler, to prevent the
signal handler from stealing the exit status [perl #105700].

=item *

The %n formatting code for C<printf> and C<sprintf>, which causes the number
of characters to be assigned to the next argument, now actually
assigns the number of characters, instead of the number of bytes.

It also works now with special lvalue functions like C<substr> and with
nonexistent hash and array elements [perl #3471, #103492].

=item *

Perl skips copying values returned from a subroutine, for the sake of
speed, if doing so would make no observable difference.  Because of faulty
logic, this would happen with the
result of C<delete>, C<shift> or C<splice>, even if the result was
referenced elsewhere.  It also did so with tied variables about to be freed
[perl #91844, #95548].

=item *

C<utf8::decode> now refuses to modify read-only scalars [perl #91850].

=item *

Freeing $_ inside a C<grep> or C<map> block, a code block embedded in a
regular expression, or an @INC filter (a subroutine returned by a
subroutine in @INC) used to result in double frees or crashes
[perl #91880, #92254, #92256].

=item *

C<eval> returns C<undef> in scalar context or an empty list in list
context when there is a run-time error.  When C<eval> was passed a
string in list context and a syntax error occurred, it used to return a
list containing a single undefined element.  Now it returns an empty
list in list context for all errors [perl #80630].

=item *

C<goto &func> no longer crashes, but produces an error message, when
the unwinding of the current subroutine's scope fires a destructor that
undefines the subroutine being "goneto" [perl #99850].

=item *

Perl now holds an extra reference count on the package that code is
currently compiling in.  This means that the following code no longer
crashes [perl #101486]:

    package Foo;
    BEGIN {*Foo:: = *Bar::}
    sub foo;

=item *

The C<x> repetition operator no longer crashes on 64-bit builds with large
repeat counts [perl #94560].

=item *

Calling C<require> on an implicit C<$_> when C<*CORE::GLOBAL::require> has
been overridden does not segfault anymore, and C<$_> is now passed to the
overriding subroutine [perl #78260].

=item *

C<use> and C<require> are no longer affected by the I/O layers active in
the caller's scope (enabled by L<open.pm|open>) [perl #96008].

=item *

C<our $::é; $é> (which is invalid) no longer produces the "Compilation
error at lib/utf8_heavy.pl..." error message, which it started emitting in
5.10.0 [perl #99984].

=item *

On 64-bit systems, C<read()> now understands large string offsets beyond
the 32-bit range.

=item *

Errors that occur when processing subroutine attributes no longer cause the
subroutine's op tree to leak.

=item *

Passing the same constant subroutine to both C<index> and C<formline> no
longer causes one or the other to fail [perl #89218]. (5.14.1)

=item *

List assignment to lexical variables declared with attributes in the same
statement (C<my ($x,@y) : blimp = (72,94)>) stopped working in Perl 5.8.0.
It has now been fixed.

=item *

Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made "U*" in the middle of
a pack template equivalent to "U0" if the input string was empty.  This has
been fixed [perl #90160]. (5.14.2)

=item *

Destructors on objects were not called during global destruction on objects
that were not referenced by any scalars.  This could happen if an array
element were blessed (e.g., C<bless \$a[0]>) or if a closure referenced a
blessed variable (C<bless \my @a; sub foo { @a }>).

Now there is an extra pass during global destruction to fire destructors on
any objects that might be left after the usual passes that check for
objects referenced by scalars [perl #36347].

=item *

Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have been read
from when parsing a here document [perl #90128]. (5.14.1)

=item *

C<each(I<ARRAY>)> is now wrapped in C<defined(...)>, like C<each(I<HASH>)>,
inside a C<while> condition [perl #90888].

=item *

A problem with context propagation when a C<do> block is an argument to
C<return> has been fixed.  It used to cause C<undef> to be returned in
certain cases of a C<return> inside an C<if> block which itself is followed by
another C<return>.

=item *

Calling C<index> with a tainted constant no longer causes constants in
subsequently compiled code to become tainted [perl #64804].

=item *

Infinite loops like C<1 while 1> used to stop C<strict 'subs'> mode from
working for the rest of the block.

=item *

For list assignments like C<($a,$b) = ($b,$a)>, Perl has to make a copy of
the
