C<splice()> doesn't warn when truncating

You can now limit the size of an array using C<splice(@a,MAX_LEN)> without
worrying about warnings.

=item *

C<< $$ >> is no longer tainted.  Since this value comes directly from
C<< getpid() >>, it is always safe.

=item *

The parser no longer leaks a filehandle if STDIN was closed before parsing
started [perl #37033].

=item *

C<< die; >> with a non-reference, non-string, or magical (e.g., tainted)
value in $@ now properly propagates that value [perl #111654].

On Solaris, we have two kinds of failure.

If F<make> is Sun's F<make>, we get an error about a badly formed macro
assignment in the F<Makefile>.  That happens when F<./Configure> tries to
make depends.  F<Configure> then exits 0, but further F<make>-ing fails.

If F<make> is F<gmake>, F<Configure> completes, then we get errors related
to F</usr/include/stdbool.h>

On Win32, a number of tests hang unless STDERR is redirected.  The cause of
this is still under investigation.

When building as root with a umask that prevents files from being
other-readable, F<t/op/filetest.t> will fail.  This is a test bug, not a
bug in perl's behavior.

Configuring with a recent gcc and link-time-optimization, such as
C<Configure -Doptimize='-O2 -flto'> fails
because the optimizer optimizes away some of Configure's tests.  A
workaround is to omit the C<-flto> flag when running Configure, but add
it back in while actually building, something like

    sh Configure -Doptimize=-O2                                             
    make OPTIMIZE='-O2 -flto'

The following CPAN modules have test failures with perl 5.16.  Patches have
been submitted for all of these, so hopefully there will be new releases
soon:

=item *

L<Date::Pcalc> version 6.1

=item *

L<Module::CPANTS::Analyse> version 0.85

This fails due to problems in L<Module::Find> 0.10 and L<File::MMagic>
1.27.

L<PerlIO::Util> version 0.72
